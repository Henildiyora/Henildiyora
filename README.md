# Henil S Diyora
M.S. in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo with a passion for building intelligent systems, from firmware to full-stack machine learning solutions.

### My Journey
My journey into technology began in software, with a deep dive into the world of machine learning during my undergraduate studies. I was fascinated by the power of data and independently studied the statistical and mathematical concepts behind ML algorithms.

This passion led me to a Data Scientist internship at Intellithink Industrial IoT. There, I engineered machine learning models to perform fault detection using high-frequency sensor data from industrial machinery. While analyzing vibration and time-series data, I grew increasingly curious about the hardware that produced it—the IoT devices, the microcontrollers, and the firmware that made it all work. I realized that my impact could be greater if I understood not just how to analyze the data, but how to build the systems that gather it.

Driven by this new interest, I began formally studying embedded systems during my Master's at the University at Buffalo. I started with the fundamentals of hardware, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and communication protocols like I2C and SPI. Now, I'm applying that knowledge by building a portfolio of hands-on projects, from real-time sensor monitors on STM32 boards to custom device drivers. My goal is to work at the intersection of these two fields, creating intelligent devices by bridging the gap between hardware and machine learning.
