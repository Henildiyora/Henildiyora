# Hi there, I'm Henil Diyora 👋

**M.S. Computer Science @ University at Buffalo** | Ex-Intellithink Industrial IoT | Building intelligent systems from firmware to full-stack ML

Bridging the gap between **embedded hardware** and **machine learning** — because real intelligence starts at the edge.

### 🌟 About Me
- Currently pursuing **Master's in Computer Science** at University at Buffalo (Expected May 2027)
- Former **Data Scientist Intern** at Intellithink Industrial IoT — built predictive maintenance systems processing 1,000+ sensor points/second
- Passionate about **edge AI**, real-time systems, and production-grade backend engineering
- Recently diving deep into **embedded systems** — STM32, FreeRTOS, device drivers, and low-level protocols
- I believe the future of AI isn't just in the cloud — it's on the device
